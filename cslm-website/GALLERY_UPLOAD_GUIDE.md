# How to Upload Photos to the Gallery

Your website gallery is now connected to Firebase Storage. Follow these simple steps to add photos:

## Step 1: Go to Firebase Console

1. Open your browser and go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Click on your project: **cslm-church**

## Step 2: Navigate to Storage

1. In the left sidebar, click on **"Storage"**
2. If this is your first time, you may need to click **"Get Started"** to enable Storage
3. You'll see the Firebase Storage browser

## Step 3: Create the Gallery Folder

1. Look for a folder icon or **"Create folder"** button
2. Create a new folder named exactly: **gallery** (all lowercase, no spaces)
3. Click into the **gallery** folder

## Step 4: Upload Photos

1. Inside the **gallery** folder, click the **"Upload file"** button
2. Select one or multiple photos from your computer
3. Supported formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
4. Wait for the upload to complete (you'll see a progress bar)

## Step 5: View Your Gallery

1. Go to your website: https://cslm-church.web.app/gallery
2. Refresh the page if needed
3. Your photos will automatically appear in the gallery!

## Tips for Best Results

### Photo Recommendations:
- **Size**: 1920x1080 pixels or larger for best quality
- **File Size**: Keep under 5 MB per photo (resize if needed)
- **Format**: JPG works best for photos
- **Orientation**: Both landscape and portrait work fine

### Organizing Photos:
- You can create subfolders inside the **gallery** folder for organization
- However, the website currently only displays photos directly in the **gallery** folder
- Delete photos you no longer want to display

### Photo Editing Tips:
- Resize large photos before uploading (using tools like Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools)
- Compress photos to reduce file size without losing quality
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., "christmas-service-2024.jpg")

## Storage Limits (Free Tier)

You have **5 GB of free storage** with Firebase, which is enough for approximately:
- 1,000+ high-quality photos (at ~4-5 MB each)
- 2,500+ optimized photos (at ~2 MB each)

This should be more than enough for your church website!

## Troubleshooting

### Photos not showing up?
1. Make sure photos are in the **gallery** folder (not a subfolder)
2. Check that folder name is exactly **gallery** (lowercase)
3. Refresh your website page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Wait a few seconds after upload for changes to reflect

### Upload failed?
1. Check your internet connection
2. Make sure photo file size is under 5 MB
3. Verify the file is an image (JPG, PNG, etc.)
